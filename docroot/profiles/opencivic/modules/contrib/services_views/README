Views support for the Services module version 3.x and later.

It has currently two features:
- Execute any view of the system via views resource call
- Create view based resource creating Services display in a view

Executing view via views resource
After enabling "views" resource in your services endpoint you can do
GET request to:

http://example.com/<endpoint path>/views/<view name>

This will execute a view and pass results.

Possible arguments:
- display_id: views display
- args: array of view arguments
- filters: array of view filter values
- offset: views offset
- limit: limit views number of results
- format_output: boolean whether we would like to get themed view or data

Example of calls:

http://example.com/rest/views/articles?limit=5&offset=2&filters[tags]=5
http://example.com/rest/views/articles?filters[tags]=5&display_id=block_1&format_output=1

Create view based resource creating Services display in a view
In any view you can create "Services" display. It has only one option setting
-- path. That will be the name of your resource. After enabling that resource
you would be able to do call to

http://example.com/<endpoint path>/<resource name>

This will execute a view and output results. You can create exposed filters and
pass them to your resource. For example if we created exposed filter "tags" call
will be:

http://example.com/<endpoint path>/<resource name>?tags=7
