Save_draft adds a 'Save as Draft' Button to the node_form for content types, 
allowing the user to click the 'Save as Draft' button to save the node as a 
draft.  This helps improve usability, as the content creator no longer has to 
search for the published checkbox as they can just click the 'Save as Draft'
Button.

Install
-------

1) Copy the save_draft folder to the modules folder in your installation.

2) Enable the module using Administer -> Site building -> Modules
   (/admin/build/modules).
