6.x to 7.x:

1. Core changed the way it identifies blocks internally. The update functions
   should handle the transition.

2. A new option for a unified login/register page has been added. See the
   'Present a unified login/registration page' setting in the 'Log in' section
   of LoginToboggan settings.
