It is highly recommended you install both the Panels and Contextual
modules alongside FAPE. 

This module allows Contextual to create a link to Panel Panes that are
entity fields allowing the fields to be edited directly.

To make use of this module, first enable the module. Then enable
Contextual and Panels. For any panel that has an entity context,
users who have access to edit the fields on that entity and have
contextual links access will see a contextual link allowing
them to edit that field in the overlay (or on a separate screen
if they do not have overlay access).

This module does not have a true dependency on Panels. If you enable
it without Panels it will not appear to do anything, but the edit
links are still usable and other modules may implement them.
