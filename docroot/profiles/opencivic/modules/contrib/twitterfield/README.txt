Description
-----------

This project aims to solve a common problem of displaying a twitter widget for a
specified username, that has been noted in various places, but never properly
developed.

The module (currently Drupal 7 only, but could easily be backported) implements 
a custom field formatter that takes the contents of a generic Text Field, 
attached to a Node, and treats it like a Twitter Username.   It then provides a
default template file (twitter-field-widget.tpl.php)  That can be overridden in 
your module, with the code generated after you configure a Twitter Profile
Widget and click the "Finish & Grab code" button at Twitter.com.

The default template provided by this module implements the Twitter Profile 
widget, with a basic color scheme. You may override the default template in your 
theme to use the custom code generated by the Profile widget generator, and may 
work with the Twitter search widget or the Twitter faves widget as well. 
Unfortunately, the Twitter List Widget requires knowledge of at least two pieces
of information (user-name, and list-name) and so it is currently not possible 
to override this widget type.

Todo
----

A planned enhancement would be to create a completely custom field type, which 
would allow for storage of two fields as one (needed for the Twitter List Widget 
implementation), but for now, we're piggybacking off of the simple text field 
type.

Usage
-----

1) Download and enable the module as usual. 
2) Create a text field called "Twitter ID" on one of your content types, with a 
max length of for example 30 characters.
3) Change the display format from "Default" to "Twitter Widget".
4) Profit!
