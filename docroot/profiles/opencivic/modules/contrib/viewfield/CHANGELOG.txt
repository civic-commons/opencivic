Viewfield 6.x-2.x, xxxx-xx-xx
-----------------------------
#416922 by keithm: Fixed update_6001 to check current size < 128 before update.
#489908 by sun, keithm: Changed default value settings to field instance level.
  - $field['super_default'] is gone, which previously allowed saving nodes
    with no viewfield value, but then to use the field's configured default
    values automatically. This had an effect only for nodes that were created
    before the viewfield was created, because viewfields in nodes created after
    any field is created receive the configured default value preselected in the
    node edit form, and CCK/Field API always stores a value, even if it is the
    same as the default value.
  - $field['super_default_widget'] is equally gone, without replacement, as it
    merely completed aforementioned functionality.
  - $field['widget']['override_default'] is also gone, ditto.
  - $field['token_enabled'] is also gone, as we can replace both legacy tokens
    and Token module tokens without conflicts.
  - Global default values are migrated to the instance level.

Viewfield 5.x-1.x, 2007-02-05
-----------------------------
by mfredrickson: Fixed ID for author argument token.
  Was using node ID instead of user ID.
#100971 by eaton, webchick, alex_b, yched, and stefano73: Updated to Drupal 5.
  Some changes to the implementation:
  * More reliance on the views formatters (as seems to be the norm for CCK
    fields now) for formatting regular node views.
  * The full node formatter is now the "default". This may break some existing
    views. It's worth the pain.
  * Added paging as per stefano73/alex_b's work. Relatively untested, but it
    looks good so far. (Thanks!)


Viewfield 4.7.x-1.x, 2006-11-10
-------------------------------
by mfredrickson: Initial commit.
  Nodes hold content. Views save queries. Wouldn't be great if a node could hold
  a saved query? Now it can. Viewfield is a CCK field module that allows
  administrators to put views directly into nodes. When creating a node, users
  can select from a list of views. When the node is displayed, the view is run
  and the content is inserted into the body of the node.
